# homies-game
a variation on set where you make sets of homies!

## A background
I've always loved the game set, and when i first learned it, my immediate thought was that it was basically explaining a set of 3 friends, who are all the same or all different in various ways.. like the Powerpuff Girls!
This iteration was built in conjunction with thaura.ai as my copilot.
I'd like to build on this game to have better illustrations and not have to use emoji, but it was expecially useful to use Unicode's skintone and gender variations to get a unique deck created as a good start of my vision.
